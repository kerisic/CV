## Christine Chee

With a background in psychological research, I began my career working as a researcher for a boutique Executive Search firm before leading on client experience for a body composition analyser software development company.

Having worked closely with developers for the last few years albeit in a client facing capacity, what was initially a spark of curiousity turned into a full blown passion for coding, which led me to enrol at Makers Academy since January 2021.

## Skills

#### Project Management

- From procurement, logistics, account management, software integration to even recruitment, project management while working across teams has been a key part of all my work.
- At Saxton Bampfylde, I ensured each 3-weekly project satisfied clients' briefs to a high standard. My role at Boditrax similarly ensured each client's pipeline was managed effectively by coordinating with our development and manufacturing departments to fulfil their orders.
- By going the extra mile in those projects, clients placed their confidence in me to oversee their accounts with a higher probability of attracting further contracts for the company.


#### Adaptability & Resilience
- Picking up new skills and working in areas previously unknown to me has been a constant in my career. With no prior operational experience, I was able to hit the ground running at Boditrax and quickly learned the ropes in managing clients and project management across departments. Positive review of my performance by the directors resulted in the creation of a new role to lead Client experience which I was promoted to 5 months after joining the company.
- I have a passion for learning and thrive in an environment where I can continually apply new knowledge to my work. For our first Asia accounts at Boditrax, while logistics was an area new to me, ample planning, research and timely communication with all parties resulted in a successful despatch worth over half a million pounds and the company became the main supplier of over 70 sites in Asia.


#### Cultivated Meaningful and Lasting Relationships
- In order to headhunt for senior appointments across different sectors, with each new brief from Saxton Bampfylde I familiarised myself with sector knowledge, the latest news, trends and leaders in the industry before reaching out to high-profile individuals directly. 
- I quickly built a rapport with them and engaged them as sources and candidates.
- With each successful appointment, my candidates go on to become clients of the firm with the knowledge that they can trust in the hiqh quality of my work therefore securing further contracts for the company.
